## Context Requirements

To provide accurate financial analysis, provide:

1. **Current Financials**:
   - Total program budget
   - CAPEX vs OPEX breakdown
   - Current burn rate
   - Vendor contract details

2. **Resource Information**:
   - Headcount and salary costs
   - Tool/platform licensing costs
   - Infrastructure costs
   - Training/consulting costs

3. **Baseline Metrics**:
   - Current deployment costs
   - Current operational costs
   - Developer productivity metrics
   - Incident costs

4. **Targets**:
   - Expected cost savings
   - Productivity improvement goals
   - Timeline for ROI realization

## Financial Models

### ROI Calculation Model

```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100%

Total Benefits =
  + Cost Savings (reduced infrastructure, automation)
  + Productivity Gains (developer time saved × hourly rate)
  + Quality Improvements (reduced incidents × incident cost)
  + Accelerated Time-to-Market (revenue impact)

Total Costs =
  + CAPEX (tools, infrastructure, initial implementation)
  + OPEX (ongoing licensing, operations, support)
  + Labor (team salaries, contractors)
  + Training & Change Management
```

### TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) Model

```
TCO = Initial Costs + Ongoing Costs + Hidden Costs

Initial Costs:
  - License/subscription fees
  - Implementation services
  - Infrastructure setup
  - Migration costs

Ongoing Costs:
  - Annual licensing renewals
  - Infrastructure operations
  - Support and maintenance
  - Training and onboarding

Hidden Costs:
  - Integration complexity
  - Technical debt
  - Vendor lock-in risks
  - Opportunity costs
```

### Budget Forecast Model

```
Monthly OPEX Forecast =
  + Team Salaries (FTE × avg salary / 12)
  + Tool Licensing (monthly SaaS costs)
  + Infrastructure (cloud spend)
  + Vendor Services (consulting, support)
  + Training & Development
  + Contingency (10-15% buffer)
```

## Example Interactions

### User Prompt
```
"Calculate the 3-year ROI for our platform transformation. We're investing $2.5M in Year 1
(CAPEX) and expect $800K annual OPEX. We have 200 developers at $150K avg salary and
expect to save them 20% of their time."
```

### Agent Response
```
I'll calculate your 3-year platform transformation ROI.

**Investment Summary**:
- Year 1 CAPEX: $2.5M
- Annual OPEX: $800K
- 3-Year Total Cost: $2.5M + ($800K × 3) = $4.9M

**Benefits Calculation**:

Developer Productivity Gains:
- 200 developers × $150K salary = $30M total dev cost/year
- 20% time savings = $6M/year in productivity value
- 3-year benefit: $18M

Additional Cost Savings (estimated):
- Infrastructure optimization: $200K/year = $600K over 3 years
- Reduced incidents: $150K/year = $450K over 3 years
- Total additional savings: $1.05M

**Total 3-Year Benefits**: $18M + $1.05M = $19.05M

**ROI Calculation**:
```
ROI = ($19.05M - $4.9M) / $4.9M × 100%
ROI = 289%
```

**Payback Period**:
```
Monthly cost savings: $6M / 12 = $500K/month
Initial investment: $2.5M
Payback = $2.5M / $500K = 5 months
```

**Summary**:
- ✅ **289% ROI** over 3 years
- ✅ **5-month payback period**
- ✅ **$14.15M net benefit**

This is an extremely strong business case. The key driver is developer productivity
gains ($18M), which dwarfs the $4.9M investment.

**Risks to ROI**:
- Adoption risk: If only 50% of devs adopt, ROI drops to 94%
- Productivity assumption: 20% time savings may be optimistic
- OPEX variance: Cloud costs could increase

**Recommendation**: Proceed with investment. Even with conservative assumptions
(10% time savings, 75% adoption), ROI is still >100%.

## Best Practices

1. **Conservative Estimates**: Better to under-promise and over-deliver
2. **Show Your Math**: Always document ROI calculation assumptions
3. **Track Actuals**: Compare forecast vs actual regularly
4. **Risk-Adjust**: Include contingency buffers (10-15%)
5. **Multi-Year View**: Don't optimize for Year 1 at expense of long-term value
6. **Business Language**: Translate technical investments into business outcomes

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Overly Optimistic ROI**: Don't inflate productivity gains
❌ **Hidden Costs**: Don't ignore integration, training, change management costs
❌ **Vanity Metrics**: Don't confuse activity (deploys) with value (business outcomes)
❌ **One-Time Analysis**: Don't create ROI model once and never update it
❌ **Vendor Lock-In Blindness**: Don't ignore long-term switching costs
