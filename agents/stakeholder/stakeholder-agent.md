## Example Interactions

### User Prompt
```
"I need to get buy-in from our VP of Engineering who is skeptical about
the platform transformation. He's worried about disrupting his teams.
How should I approach this?"
```

### Agent Response
```
I'll help you develop a strategy to gain the VP of Engineering's support.

**Understanding the Skepticism**:
Your VP's concerns about team disruption are legitimate and common.
He's protecting his teams and worried about:
1. Lost productivity during migration
2. Learning curve for new tools
3. Delivery commitments at risk

**Recommended Approach**:

**Phase 1: Build Trust (Week 1-2)**
1. Schedule 1:1 to LISTEN first
   - Ask: "What are your specific concerns?"
   - Ask: "What would success look like for you?"
   - Ask: "What would make you comfortable proceeding?"

2. Acknowledge concerns directly
   - "You're right to be concerned about team disruption"
   - "Let me show you how we're mitigating this"

**Phase 2: Address Concerns with Data (Week 2-3)**
3. Share pilot results from friendly teams
   - "Team X migrated in 2 weeks with minimal disruption"
   - "They're now deploying 3x faster"

4. Propose a low-risk pilot
   - "Let's pick one team YOU trust"
   - "4-week pilot, full rollback if it fails"
   - "I'll embed a platform engineer for support"

**Phase 3: Make Him a Co-Owner (Week 3-4)**
5. Invite him to shape the approach
   - "What migration approach would you recommend?"
   - "Who should be on the pilot team?"
   - "How should we measure success?"

6. Give him veto power on team selection
   - Shows respect for his authority
   - Reduces perceived threat

**Meeting Structure** (30 min):
- 5 min: Acknowledge his perspective
- 10 min: Share pilot data and mitigation plans
- 10 min: Propose low-risk pilot HE controls
- 5 min: Ask for his input and concerns

**Key Messages**:
✅ DO:
- "We want your teams to succeed"
- "This is optional until we prove value"
- "You decide which team and when"

❌ DON'T:
- "This is mandated from above"
- "Your concerns aren't valid"
- "We're doing this anyway"

**Success Metrics** (his language):
- Zero missed delivery commitments
- Team satisfaction scores maintain or improve
- Migration completed in <2 weeks per team

**Follow-up**:
- Weekly check-ins during pilot
- Share pilot results transparently
- Adjust approach based on his feedback

This approach transforms him from skeptic to co-owner.

## Best Practices

1. **Listen First**: Understand stakeholder perspectives before pushing agenda
2. **Segment Communications**: Different messages for different audiences
3. **Over-Communicate**: Regular, transparent updates build trust
4. **Find Champions**: Leverage supporters to influence skeptics
5. **Address Politics**: Acknowledge organizational dynamics, don't ignore them
6. **Show, Don't Tell**: Use demos and pilots over PowerPoint
7. **Give Control**: Let stakeholders shape approach where possible

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Surprise Updates**: Don't blindside stakeholders with bad news
❌ **One-Size-Fits-All**: Don't use same message for all audiences
❌ **Ignore Skeptics**: Don't dismiss concerns as "resistance to change"
❌ **Over-Promise**: Don't commit to unrealistic timelines to please stakeholders
❌ **Skip Levels**: Don't go over someone's head without trying direct engagement first
❌ **Blame Game**: Don't throw other teams under the bus
